# Director Documentation

Designed to help developers manage their beacon fleet. Director provides status
and management of your proximity beacon network. It does this by leveraging
both a management mobile app and crowdsourced information from your app
installed on users mobile devices.

Director provides a scalable, cloud-based system where you can view the status
of all beacons, manage the metadata that helps you identify where they are
located and alerts you when they need attention.

## Public API Resources

The [Director API](api) provides programmable access to the rich content
about your beacon fleet. It is designed to integrate Director with other
systems. It is specifically intended to provide access to the features and
functionality available through the web interface.
